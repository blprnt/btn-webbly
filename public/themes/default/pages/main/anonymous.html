<p>
  This is the code platform for Binoculars to Binomials. It's a place where you can make and share fun web projects that are about birds and data.

  If you're part of the <a href="https://jerthorp.me/learning" target="_blank">Binoculars to Binomials</a> community, you can sign up for an account. If you're not part of the BtB community you can request an account, too. If I know you or if you reach out I will approve it.
</p>

<h2>Log in</h2>

<p>If you already have an account, just log in:</p>

<ul>
  {% for entry in availableProviders %}
    <li>
      using
      <a href="/auth/{{ entry.service }}"
        >{{ entry.service_domain or entry.service }}</a
      >
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>

<p>
  But if you don't, and the above all sounds reasonable, then you'll probably
  want to sign up.
</p>

<ul>
  <li class="full-width">
    <form id="signup" method="POST">
      <p>
        <label>Step 1: pick a username:</label>
        <input
          type="text"
          placeholder="Write your username here"
          autocomplete="new-password"
        />
        <br />
        <span style="color: red"></span>
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 2: pick which auth service you want to be your primary login
        method:
        {% for entry in availableProviders %}
          <button class="provider" data-name="{{ entry.service }}" disabled>
            {{ entry.service_domain or entry.service }}
          </button>
        {% endfor %}
      </p>
    </form>

    <hr />

    <p>
      Note that your user name is "what you want people to see". Whether you
      will be able to register that will be based on whether or not that name's
      "slug" equivalent (i.e. a url-safe equivalent) is already taken or not.
    </p>

    <p>
      Also note that you can add additional authentication methods once your
      account has been enabled, so that even if you lose access to a service,
      you're not suddenly also locked out of your account here.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>


<h2>I signed up but I can't do anything?</h2>

<p>
  Accounts are created in a "disabled" state, requiring an admin to enable them
  before they can actually use the editor (beyond what anonymous visitors can
  do). If we know each other, shoot me a message saying you signed up and I'll
  immediately enable your account, but if I have no idea who you are, it's quite
  likely that I'll just delete your account...
</p>

<h2>Starter projects</h2>

<p>
  This instance comes with a bunch of starter projects that you can remix so you
  don't have to start from scratch, including a basic "single page" HTML/CSS/JS
  website, a Node.js site that uses Express to run a simple webserver, and even
  a web graphics demo that lets you write interactive graphics code in JS.
</p>

<p>
  And if none of that sounds appealing, there's also an "empty project" that
  comes with Node.js (with npm) and Python (with pip) preinstalled, and an empty
  run script so that you can set up whatever you need in order to do that crazy
  thing you're thinking about. Just remember that folks trust you to not abuse
  the platform: don't hog the bandwidth, and don't eat all the disk space. If
  that's what you want to do, just go run your own instance, and then you can do
  literally whatever you want!
</p>

{% if projectList %}
  <h2>What are folks doing on this instance?</h2>

  <p>
    If you just want to see some cool stuff that's happening on this instance,
    here are the five most recent projects that people have been working on. You
    can fire each of them up in the editor view (although of course as a random
    visitor you will not be able to edit anything), or you can open the
    associated websites by clicking the link at the bottom of each project card.
  </p>

  <p>
    Note that not all projects may be running, but if they are: those are not
    screenshots, you're looking at the websites running as an embed. And if
    they're interactive, you can interact with them. Or you can open them in
    their own tab to experience them as proper, full website, of course!
  </p>

  <ul>
    {% for project in projectList %}
      {% include "fragments/project-card.html" %}
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
{% endif %}

<h2>Is this open source?</h2>

<p>✨ You better believe it ✨</p>

<p>
  Head on over to
  <a
    href="https://github.com/Pomax/make-webbly-things?tab=readme-ov-file#use-the-web-to-build-the-web"
    >https://github.com/Pomax/make-webbly-things</a
  >
  to read about the platform itself, and see all the code for it so you can
  check whether you trust that or not. Or even dive in and help implement new
  features or fix bugs!
</p>

<p>
  In fact, things are so open source that even the projects folks make on this
  platform are open source. If you don't want people to see your code, this is
  not the place for you, but if you want to make cool stuff in a way that others
  can learn from, can remix into their own projects, or that you could even
  collaborate with on group projects, then this might very well be the thing for
  you.
