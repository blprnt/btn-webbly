#
# This script will take a git history, and perform
# a squash operation that turns "all commits older
# than a day" into a single base commit that replaces
# the existing base commit for the repository.
#
# One day is a bit aggressive, but this is a PoC
# script more than anything right now. In real
# use, you'd make it collapse everything older
# than a month into "the new base commit", squash
# anything older than 7 days into one commit per
# day, and leave the most recent week of commits
# untouched.
#
# So that you can do sensible rollbaks.
#

# Run this with ./squash-old.sh projectname
